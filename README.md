# 📡 Phone Network Design using MST Algorithms

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a **Phone Network System** using **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms**. The aim is to efficiently connect multiple office locations with **minimum cost** while ensuring full connectivity. The project was developed as part of the **CPCS 324: Algorithms and Data Structures II** course.

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ **Graph Representation:** Reads graph data from a file and represents it as an adjacency list.
- ✅ **Random Graph Generation:** Generates graphs with different sizes and edge densities for performance analysis.
- ✅ **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Computation:** Implements two MST algorithms:
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm** (Union-Find based implementation)
  - **Min-Heap Based Prim's Algorithm**
- ✅ **Performance Analysis:** Compares the execution time of Kruskal and Prim algorithms for large datasets.
- ✅ **Results Printing:** Prints the computed MST and total cost for both algorithms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Java

## 📌 Input Graph vs. Output Graph  

The visualization below illustrates the impact of applying **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms** on a graph:  

1. **Before Applying MST:**  
   - Shows the original graph with all its edges.  

2. **After Applying MST:**  
   - Displays only the **minimum-weight edges** that connect all vertices, forming the MST.  
   - Eliminates unnecessary edges while ensuring full connectivity at minimal cost.  

This comparison visually demonstrates how Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms efficiently reduce the graph to its most optimal spanning structure.

## 📌 System Components
### 📜 Graph Representation
The project defines a **Graph Framework** consisting of:
- **Graph Class:** Represents the graph with vertices and edges.
- **Vertex Class:** Defines properties of graph nodes.
- **Edge Class:** Defines connections between vertices with weights.

### 📊 MST Algorithms Implementation
#### 1️⃣ Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Uses **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** to avoid cycles.
- Sorts edges in ascending order and selects edges greedily.
- Outputs the MST and its cost.

#### 2️⃣ Min-Heap Based Prim’s Algorithm
- Uses a **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** to find the minimum edge efficiently.
- Expands MST by always selecting the lowest cost edge.
- Outputs the MST and its cost.
